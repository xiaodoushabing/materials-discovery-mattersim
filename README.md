## 1. Installation

#### Prerequisite
- `Python 3.12x`
- While the MatterSim authors recommend `Python 3.9`, this project is optimized for `Python 3.12.x`.

#### Install from PyPI
To run MatterSim, the authors recinnebd creating a clean conda environment to avoid potential package conflicts. You can create and activate a conda environment with the following commands:
   ```bash
   # create the environment
   conda create -n mattersim python=3.12

   # activate the environment
   conda activate mattersim
```

An alternative is to use a Docker container. You can set up a Docker container using NVIDIA‚Äôs official PyTorch image:
   ```bash
   # pull the docker image
   docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.12-py3

   # run the docker image
   docker run --gpus all -it --rm nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.12-py3
   ```
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/xiaodoushabing/materials-discovery-mattersim.git
   cd materials-discovery/matter/
   ```
2. Install dependencies as necessary. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or install dependencies manually. Note that downloading the dependencies may take some time:
   
## 2. Streamlit app (Structure Analysis with MatterSim)

This Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing atomic and crystal structures using the MatterSim force field. It allows users to define structures, perform structural relaxations, and run molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

#### Features

* **Model and Device Selection:**
  * Choose between different MatterSim models (1M, 5M).
  * Select the computation device (CUDA if available, or CPU).
* **Structure Building:** Create atomic structures using either:
    * **Crystal Builder:** Defines structures based on space group and lattice parameters, ensuring crystallographic symmetry.
    * **Atoms Builder:** Defines structures by specifying atomic symbols and Cartesian coordinates. This also allows running molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
* **Structure Perturbation:** Introduce random atomic displacements ("rattle") to simulate structural variations.
* **Structural Relaxation:** Optimize structures using BFGS or FIRE algorithms with optional filters (ExpCellFilter, FrechetCellFilter) and symmetry constraints.
* **Energy Calculation:** Calculate potential energy of the given structure.
* **Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations:** Run MD simulations with different ensembles (NVT_NOSE_HOOVER, NVT_BERENDSEN).
* **Pressure and Temperature Control:**
  * Perform relaxation at pressures ‚â• 0 GPa.
  * Run MD simulations at temperatures > 0 K.

* **Parameter Control:**  Fine-grained control over relaxation and MD simulation parameters.
* **Result Display:** Show computed energies, lattice parameters, and other relevant information.
* **Visualisation:** Interactive 3D visualization of the structures.

#### Running the app
You can access the hosted version of the app at:

üëâ [mattersim.streamlit.app](mattersim.streamlit.app)

Alternatively, to run the app locally, use the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
This will open the app in your web browser.

#### Usage
**Model and Device Configuration:** In the sidebar, select the desired MatterSim model (1M or 5M) and choose the computational device (CUDA or CPU). If no GPU is detected, CPU will be selected by default.

**Structure Definition:** Choose between Crystal Builder and Atoms Builder, then provide the necessary inputs such as atomic symbols, basis positions, lattice parameters, and space group (if applicable).

> üö® Crystal Builder takes in **fractional** coordinates, while Atoms Builder takes in **cartesean** coordinates.

**Structure Perturbation (Optional):** Toggle the "Rattle" option to introduce small random displacements to atomic positions, simulating structural variations.

**Lattice Visualisation:** Adjust the "Number of cells to display per axis" to control the size of the visualized structure in the 3D viewer.

**Initial Structure:** The initial structure is displayed with its energy and lattice parameters, calculated at 0 K and 0 GPa.

**Relax Structure:** Configure relaxation parameters in the sidebar and click "Relax Structure" to perform structural relaxation. The relaxed structure and corresponding results will be displayed.

**Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation (Atoms Builder only):** Configure MD simulation parameters and click ‚ÄúStart MD simulation‚Äù to initiate the simulation.

#### Key observations

##### 1. Reproducibility of predictions

For 1000 identical silicon diamond structures generated using `si = bulk("Si", "diamond", a=5.43)`, predictions for energy, force, and stress remain largely consistent. However, small variations are observed when using batch processing. This discrepancy is likely due to numerical precision differences introduced during batched computations.

To confirm this, inference on 1000 identical structures was performed individually:
```python
# Run individual predictions for 1000 identical Si structures
bulk_predictions = []
for _ in range(1000):
    si = bulk("Si", "diamond", a=5.43)
    si.calc = MatterSimCalculator(load_path=f"MatterSim-v1.0.0-{model}M.pth", device=device)
    bulk_predictions.append(si.get_potential_energy())

# Verify consistency
for i in range(1000):
    assert bulk_predictions[i] == bulk_predictions[0], f"Energy of structure {i} is different: {bulk_predictions[i]}!"
```
Since this assertion returned no errors, it confirms that individual computations produce identical results. The observed variations in batched inference likely stem from floating-point precision differences or computational optimizations performed during batch processing.

##### 2. Energy minimization through relaxation
As expected, structural relaxation consistently lowers the energy of the 1000 identical Si diamond structures.

##### 3. Impact of atomic displacement on predictions
1000 identical Si diamond structures were perturbed using `si.rattle(stdev=np.random.random())`. Introducing random atomic displacements results in significantly increased variation in predicted energies, forces, and stresses.  This reflects the sensitivity of these properties to structural changes.

##### 4. Energy convergence after relaxation
Despite the initial variation in predicted energies due to the random perturbations, subsequent structural relaxation brings the energies of the 1000 structures into a narrower, more consistent range.  This indicates that relaxation effectively minimizes the energy of the perturbed structures, leading to a more homogeneous energetic state.
